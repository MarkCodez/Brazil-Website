				is Brazil?</h2>
			<p class="bscinfo" style="padding:15px;"> Brazil is officially known as the Federative Republic of Brazil
				and is a country in South America that occupies half the continent’s landmass. It is the fifth largest
				country in the world, exceeded in size only by Russia, Canada, China, and the United States. Its area is
				greater than that of the 48 conterminous U.S. states. Brazil has over 211 million people living there,
				with more than 6% of people living there living in favelas. Income inequality in Brazil has been the
				main factor in many current issues that affect Brazil. The government of Brazil cares only about money
				and prioritizes the rich. This is even affecting the environment of Brazil. </p>

				really happens in Brazil?</h2>

			<p class="bscinfo2" style="padding:15px;"> The six wealthiest people in Brazil have the same fortune as the
				bottom half of the population, or almost 100 million individuals. The top 5% of earners make the same
				amount as the other 95%. The six wealthiest men in Brazil would need 36 years to exhaust their wealth if
				they combined their resources and spent $319,000 (about $1 million) daily. 16 million Brazilians are
				considered to be below the poverty level. Brazil's government has taken some tragic actions to destroy
				the Amazon rainforest when it comes to ecology. Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019. Among other things,
				he worked to erode Indigenous land rights, reduced funding for scientific and environmental agencies,
				sacked ecological specialists, removed enforcement measures, and supported the agribusiness industry.

					rainforest is being cleared and burned. </p>
