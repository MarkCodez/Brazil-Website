		<strong>Brazil's economy has had its ups and downs throughout their history, evidenced by the cycle of booms and
			busts. Their failures mostly come from inadequate government management which has resulted in high rates of
			inflation. This has been mostly due to the governments policies of deficit spending and corrupt practices
			that ignored certain restricions and fiscal reforms. Although economic conditions are difficult for many
			citizens, Brazil still has a lot of potential. The country has many resources to offer the country with them
			being one of the world leaders of mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. Additionally, the world's primary
			source of coffee, oranges, sugar, soy, and beef come from Brazil.</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>In recent years, Brazil's economy and its citizens have faced economic challenges resulting from the
			COVID-19 pandemic. Shutdowns affected supply chain operations which limited exports and pandemic-related
			fiscal spending weakened the countrys economic position. These economic impacts have affected social issues
			as well creating an increase in food insecurity and deaths caused by the pandemic. Brazillians that have
			been affected the most are located in the more rural areas that include the poorest regions of the country.
			Since economic disparity is so prevelant in many parts of Brazil, the country has put into action policies
			to adress access to food, energy, and employment.</strong>
		<br>

		<strong>Continue reading more below to find out how the country is working towards addressing economic issues
			pertaining to the U.N. goals for eliminating poverty, providing affordable and clean energy, and improving
			work and economic growth.</strong>

					<h1>Economic Inequality</h1>
					<p><img align="right" src="img/20.jpg" alt="Economy in Brazil" class="economyImg">
						Brazil has a significant poverty rate with a large percentage of the population living below the
						national poverty line. Poverty rates in Brazil have expanded and contracted along with the
						governments cash transfer programs such as the Bolsa Familia program. The latest report from the
						World Bank provides the poverty rate percentage jumped up to 28.4% following a reduction in the
						program caused by the economic downtown faced during the pandemic. Households income have yet to
						improve either, driven by scarce job opportunies among vulnerable groupsm reduction to
						government offerings, and a rise in inflation casuing a decline in households purchasing power.
						<br>
						<br>
						On the other end of the spectrum, high-income earners under the wealthiest 10% of the population
						account for more than 40% of the country's total income; while the poorest 10% make up less than
						1% of total income. This makes Brazil one of the most unequal countries as far as income is
						distributed. Further investments in infrastructure may help to combat unemployment in poorer
						regions, but the government must be careful about what they spend so they do not run into
						economic deficit problems again.
						<br>
						<br>
						In order to address the income disparity gap, the Brazillian government has implemented several
						policies and measures that aim at increasing resources to those living in poverty. Some of these
						measures include the Bolsa Familia program, raising minumum wage across the country, increasing
						access to eduaction in rural areas and indigenous groups, and creating progressive tax policies.
						These policies and measures are steps in the right direction, however progress has been slow as
						it takes significant changes to many areas that affect the economy.

				<div class="poverty">
					<h1>Affordable & Clean Energy</h1>
					<p><img align="left" src="img/22.jpg" alt="Energy in Brazil" class="energyImg">Brazil has been
						working to increase renewable energy sources in the country with investments in wind, solar, and
						hydropower. Currently a majority of energy production is coming from hydropower which has its
						benefits and weaknesses. Relying on hydropower as a major source of energy has disadvantages
						since energy output is subject to fluctuations in rainfall. More importantly, this energy source
						has show to have negative impacts on the environment.
						<br>
						<br>
						It would be beneficial for the country to focus more renewable energy investmensts in a diverse
						range of sources that are not subject to fluctiation in output. Additionally, creating more
						renewable energy infrastructure will promote economic growth since it will create more jobs.
						These projects would be most beneficial in rural areas that are largely affected by poverty.

			<div class="card-deck">
				<div class="housing">
					<h1>Work & Economic Growth</h1>
					<p><img align="right" src="img/21.jpg" alt="Economy in Brazil" class="economyImg">The poor economic
						conditions of the country have largely been affected by the minimal amount of education and job
						opportunities available to the population. Many families living in poverty have to find
						alternative methods to make money and support themselves resulting in child labor and a drop in
						education rates. Promoting economic growth is a difficult challenge when the country is already
						in a slump and disparity among groups keeps the gap widened.
						<br>
						<br>
						Increasing job growth in the country has been a slow process as it requires additional
						infrastrucutre to create these jobs. After getting hit hard by the pandemic and previous
						economic conditions, the country is not in the best place to be making large investments. Brazil
						is going to be mostly reliant on exports and the growth of supply chain as they make up a
						significant percentage from these resources. As the country comes out of the pandemic, they may
						see more growth in these areas and be able to make more progress towards addressing economic
						opportunites in the country.
