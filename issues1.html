  <div class="row-one">
    <div class="col-md-7" style="float:left; background-color: #fffbb9; border-radius: 20px;">
    <h2 class="one-heading" style="font-family: 'Lora'; font-weight: bold; color: #0066CC; padding:15px;"> Social Issues</h2>
    <p class="bscinfo" style="padding: 15px;">
        <strong>Poverty and income inequality</strong> - Brazil has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, with a large portion of the population living in poverty. This is a large contributor to many of the country’s social problems since access to education and employment are key components to growing the economy. Income disparities are apparent in Brazil’s favelas, which are informal settlements prevalent in urban areas as a result of limited access to economic resources and a lack of affordable housing.
    <br>
    <br>
        <strong>Education</strong> - The education system in Brazil has dealt with many challenges as it is severely lacking resources to certain socioeconomic groups. The education disparity is signified by the low completion rates of primary and secondary school from lower-income families. Many of these children end up getting jobs to help support the family, evidenced by the large percentage of child labor in the country.
    <br>
    <br>
        <strong>Crime and violence</strong> - There is a high rate of violent crimes, such as murders and robberies in Brazil. The crime rate is influenced by economic inequality and is more prominent in urban areas. Lack of resources within law enforcement has made it difficult to address the high crime rate, which has been largely influenced by gang violence.
    <br>
    <br>
        <strong>Healthcare</strong> - Access to healthcare is limited for many Brazilians, particularly those living in favelas. Healthcare infrastructure has been prioritized in wealthier regions, whereas rural and poorer areas have limited resources.

        <h2 class="two-heading" style="font-family: 'Lora'; font-weight: bold; color: #0066CC; padding:15px;"> Political Issues </h2>
   <p class="bscinfo2" style="padding: 15px;">
        <strong>Political instability</strong> - Brazil has experienced political turmoil in recent years with the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016 for breaking budget laws in order to hide the size of the country’s budget deficit, and impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro in 2021 in relation handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    <br>
    <br>
        <strong>Corruption</strong> - Brazil has been plagued by corruption scandals involving politicians and business leaders, which has tarnished public trust in the government. Operation Car Wash refers to the massive investigation that began in 2014 and uncovered a string of corruption across politicians, business leaders, and government officials. The investigation discovered bribes made in connection with these individuals and the state-owned oil company Petrobras in order to secure contracts with the company.  
    <br>
    <br>
        <strong>Human Rights</strong>- In recent years the political climate in Brazil has become increasingly polarized, with a deeper divide between left-wing and right-wing parties. This polarization has created more disparity between groups as it is more difficult for these parties to come to an agreement and pass meaningful reforms.

    <h2 class="three-heading" style="font-family: 'Lora'; font-weight: bold; color: #0066CC; padding:15px;"> Environmental Issues</h2>
    <p class="bscinfo" style="padding: 15px;">
       <strong>Deforestation</strong> - The Amazon rainforest is being threatened by deforestation driven by agriculture and mining. Deforestation releases carbon dioxide in the air which contributes to climate change. This has been a major contributor to climate change since the rainforest holds a large part of the biomass in the world and it has been significantly decreasing with no signs of stopping. 
    <br>
    <br>
        <strong>Carbon Emissions</strong> - Brazil is one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gasses, with a majority of these emissions coming from deforestation and burning fossil fuels. Agriculture and transport emissions are also significant factors that have contributed to the number of carbon emissions in Brazil. The country contributes a large amount of agriculture to the world and some of the largest agriculture industries in Brazil are beef, soybeans, sugar, and coffee.
    <br>
    <br>
       <strong>Water pollution</strong> - Brazil's rivers and waterways are often polluted, which has had negative impacts on human health and the environment. Many communities lack proper access to clean and safe water sources caused by pollution from industries such as mining and agriculture. There is also a significant amount of urban pollution brought on by the inadequate resources and infrastructure needed to treat wastewater. As a result, untreated sewage along with other pollutants are often released into rivers and lakes.
